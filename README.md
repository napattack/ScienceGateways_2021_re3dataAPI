# Examples for using the re3data API

[re3data](https://www.re3data.org/) is a global registry providing detailed descriptions of more than 2600 research data repositories. These descriptions are based on the [re3data Metadata Schema](https://www.re3data.org/schema/2-2) and can be accessed via the [re3data API](https://www.re3data.org/api/doc).

There are many conceivable use cases for re3data metadata. In this GitHub repository, we provide example for using the re3data API.
The example is implemented in R using Jupyter Notebooks, which can be run in binder here (it may take a while to build):

Currently, we provide notebook for one use case:
* **How-to-use-re3data-API.ipynb** - identify and collect information about repositories and their API endpoint and API Type. 

The notebooks can be adapted to fit other use cases. If your specific use case is not covered here, feel free to [contact us](mailto:info@re3data.org).
